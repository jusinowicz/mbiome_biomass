All grasslands have a long history of grazing (at least 100 years by \nsheep, cattle and horses) and have developed high small‐scale vas-\ncular plant species richness (on average 27 species\/m2; Pärtel et al., \n1999; Wilson, Peet, Dengler, & Pärtel, 2012). Surface‐sterilized seeds were germinated in a greenhouse (am-\nbient conditions) on moist, sterilized sand. Upon germination, the \nseedlings were transferred to a common garden and two seedlings \nof each species were transplanted into 3.5 litre pots (19 cm in diame-\nter, 14.5 cm in height) containing a soil and sand mixture (see details \nbelow), resulting in 16 seedlings per pot in total. Seedling positions \nin pots were randomly assigned, with the restriction that seedlings \nwere at least 2 cm apart from each other and 3 cm away from the \nedge of the pot. Seedling positions and identities were marked with \ncoloured pins to enable monitoring of seedling survival over time. In the first three weeks of the experiment, dead seedlings were re-\nplaced with conspecifics originating from the same community or, \nin cases when no more conspecific seedlings were available, a seed-\nling of a different species from the same community was used. As \na result, species composition varied slightly between pots, but the \nplant population origin remained constant, and no significant biases \nin plant community composition were introduced in relation to the \ncommunity type, activated carbon and soil inoculation treatments \ndescribed in the experimental design below (Table S1). Pots were maintained in the common garden (Tartu, Estonia; \nmean annual temperature: 5.8°C, mean annual precipitation: \n680 mm) where plants were exposed to natural precipitation and \nreceived additional watering when necessary. Pot positions were \nrandomized each month. The experiment lasted for three growing \nseasons (between June 2012 and August 2014). No fertilizer was \napplied; non‐target species were regularly removed by weeding \nwhile allowing the regeneration of target species by clonal propa-\ngation (primarily in C. flacca, but also P. officinarum and G. verum) in \nthe second and third years of the experiment and by seed (all species \nflowered by the end of the experiment). Mature Asteracea seeds, \nwhich are specifically adapted to disperse by wind, were manually \ncollected and placed on the soil surface of “home” pots to prevent \nwind dispersal. All species survived to the end of the experiment, \nthough there were local extinctions at the pot level. Overall, species \ndiversity increased over time as a result of graminoid dominance de-\ncreasing and forb abundance increasing (Figure S1). 2.2 | Experimental design\nPlants were subjected to a factorial combination of three treatments: \ncommunity type, activated carbon addition and soil inoculation \n(Figure 1). Plants were grown in either local or mixed communities. In \nlocal communities, all seedlings originated from seed collected from \nthe same site (three unique sites); in mixed communities, one replicate \nindividual of each species originated from one site and the other repli-\ncate of each species from a different site (three pairwise combinations \nof sites). Hence, six unique communities were created in total. All pots \n(3.5 L) were filled with a mixture of fine sand (grain size < 0.2 mm) \nand soil (rendzic leptosol) brought from calcareous grassland in North \nEstonia (a different site from the three sites used for seed and in-\noculum collection), at a ratio 1:2. The soil mixture was sterilized by \ngamma irradiation (dose 15 kGy). Each pot received 200 g of natural \nsoil inoculum, which was either left intact (non‐sterile inoculum) or \nwas sterilized by gamma irradiation before adding to the pots (ster-\nile inoculum). The origin of soil inoculum varied depending on plant \ncommunity origin. In the local community treatment, the origin of soil \ninoculum was matched to the origin of the plant community. In the \nmixed community treatment, soil inoculum from one of the sites was \nadded to each pot such that half of the seedlings in that pot experi-\nenced “home” soil biota and the other half of the seedlings experi-\nenced unfamiliar soil biota (“away” inoculum). Among the ten replicate \npots of each mixed community, five pots received the inoculum from \none site and five pots from the other site. Therefore, mixed communi-\nties simulated a situation where the local community is invaded by dis-\ntant plant populations with no history of co‐existence (e.g. as a result \nof habitat restoration with seed collected from elsewhere). The soil inoculation treatment was combined with the addition \nof activated carbon: half of the pots received no activated carbon \nand half of the pots were filled with substrate that was mixed with \nactivated carbon powder at the rate of 8 g per pot (resulting in a ratio \n1:420; Compo, Münster, Germany). Activated carbon was reapplied \nevery spring at the same rate per pot in the form of a water suspen-\nsion. Activated carbon is known to adsorb organic compounds from \nsoil solution and has been used in previous studies to remove root \nexudates from the substrate, diminishing their impact on plant–plant \ninteractions (Callaway & Aschehoug, 2000; Callaway et al., 2005). As \nsuch, activated carbon is a tool to manipulate chemical interactions \nin the soil, including those mediated directly by exudates released \nby live roots as well as indirect interactions involving modification \nof exudates by microbial communities (Cipollini, Rigsby, & Barto, \n2012). There were ten replicates of each combination of community \ntype × activated carbon × soil inoculum, resulting in 240 pots in total. Plant shoots were cut at 1 cm height in September 2012. Shoot \nharvesting was repeated at the end of July in 2013 and 2014. Plants \nwere sorted to an individual at the first harvest and to species at the \nsecond and third harvests (separation of individuals was impossible \ndue to clonal and seed propagation), were oven‐dried at 75°C for \n48 hr and weighed. To estimate below‐ground biomass production and root mor-\nphology, two cylindrical soil cores were taken per pot (diameter 2 cm, \ndepth 14.5 cm) at the end of the first growth season (September \n2012). The cores were positioned randomly in the central area of \nthe pot (at least 3 cm away from the pot edge) and avoiding root-\ning points of any of the plants. After the removal of the soil cores, \nthe gaps were filled with the same soil mixture as used at the start \nof the experiment. The roots were washed, scanned using Epson \nPerfection V700 PHOTO scanner and analysed with WinRhizo \n2008a software (Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada) to mea-\nsure root diameter and length. Root biomass was dried for 48 hr at \n75°C and weighed. Specific root length (SRL) was calculated as the \nratio of root length to root dry mass. |  2615\nJournal of Ecology\nSEMCHENKO et al. 2.3 | Statistical analysis\nPlant mortality was analysed using generalized linear mixed effects \n(glmer) models with binomial error distributions, plant community \ncomposition (six levels: three communities composed of genotypes \nfrom a single site and three mixtures) and pot identity as random fac-\ntors, and community type (local or mixed), activated carbon addition, \ninoculation (sterile or unsterilized soil inoculum) and all interactions \nas fixed factors. Plant mortality was only analysed in the first 2 years \nof the experiments as seedling recruitment in the third year made it \nimpossible to accurately estimate the mortality of original individu-\nals. Community biomass and diversity, and root morphology were \nanalysed using linear mixed models (lmer) with loge‐transformed \nbiomass, root diameter, specific root length, or exponential Shannon \nindex (i.e. effective species number, with eight being maximum if \nall species were evenly represented), as a response variable, com-\nmunity composition (six levels) as a random factor, and community \ntype (local or mixed), activated carbon and soil inoculation (sterile or \nunsterilized soil inoculum) treatments and all interactions as fixed \nfactors. In the mortality analysis, species was included in the model \nas an additional random factor. Separate models were performed for \ndata from each year of the experiment. To assess the home soil advantage or disadvantage on plant bio-\nmass and mortality, data from communities composed of population \nmixtures (mixed community type) were used. Individuals within each \npot were split into plants that were exposed to their home soil or soil \nfrom an unfamiliar site, and generalized linear mixed models were \nperformed with community composition (three population mixtures) \nand pot identity as random factors, and activated carbon, soil in-\noculation (sterile or unsterlized soil inoculum), soil inoculum origin \n(home or away) and all interactions as fixed factors. This analysis was \nonly performed on the data from the end of the first growing season, \nas clonal spread of some individuals did not allow reliable tracing of \nthe origin of each individual in subsequent years. All analyses were \nperformed in R version 3.4.0 (R Core Team, 2017)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-06-10T17:08:29.802149Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T18:49:41.717388Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":6,"annotations":[{"id":6,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":11,"text":"Inoculation","labels":["TREATMENT"]},"id":"BzHOXOmnqK","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":17,"end":27,"text":"soil

This confirms previous observations that species with low \nreliance on mycorrhizal fungi have net negative interactions with \nsoil biota (Cortois, Schröder‐Georgi, Weigelt, van der Putten, & De \nDeyn, 2016; Semchenko et al., 2018), and if such species tend to \nbe most competitive in their resident communities, the negative \nimpact of soil biota could enhance species co‐existence (Heinze, \nBergmann, Rillig, & Joshi, 2015; Lekberg et al., 2018). Here we \nshow that such regulatory effects of soil biota significantly af-\nfected the first 2  years of plant community assembly and were \nparticularly pronounced in communities comprised of local plant \ngenotypes and local soil inoculum. Therefore, interactions with \nbelow‐ground pathogens and mutualists become a stronger driver \nof seedling establishment and co‐existence in ancient grassland \ncommunities compared to communities established from geno-\ntypes with no previous history of co‐evolution. In addition to stronger effects of soil biota in communities com-\nposed of local genotypes, we found a home‐field disadvantage in \nmixed communities. We found that plant genotypes interacting with \n“home” biota showed reduced productivity compared with gen-\notypes within the same community that were exposed to “away” \nbiota. This finding agrees with studies on local adaptation in host–\npathogen systems where pathogens tend to be ahead of their hosts \nin the evolutionary arms race and hence cause more damage to local \nplants (Höckerstedt et al., 2018; Kraemer & Boynton, 2017). As a \nresult, plants can experience below‐ground enemy release and be-\ncome invasive when introduced to a new continent or as a result \nof climate‐driven range expansion (Blumenthal, Mitchell,

main treatment \nvariables were tested in the experiment: AMF \ninoculation, initial fertilizer doses, seed rates \nand re-fertilization (Table 1). Lyme grass seed\nSeeds of lyme grass from a local source were \nprovided by the Soil Conservation Service, \nGunnarsholt, Iceland, coated with silt dust to \nincrease the specific density and to even out the \nseed surface to facilitate passage through a drill \nmachine. At the coastal site (Figure 1) two seed \nrates were tested, 3.8 and 7.6 g m-2; the latter is \na normal rate of coated seeds. The seed stock \nhad around a 75% germination rate which meant \nthat the seed doses contained around 50 and 100 \nviable seeds m-2 (Table 1). At the inland site the \nseed rate was fixed at the higher seed rate, 7.6 \nFigure 1.

Inoculum\nThe inoculum tested was a commercial AMF \ninoculum, \nTerraVital-D \n(Plantworks \nLtd. \nSittingbourne, UK) and contained five AMF \nisolates: Rhizophagus iregularis (syn. Glomus \nintraradices) BEG98, G. mosseae BEG25, G. hoi \nIS1, G. geosporum BEG11 and G. claroideum \nIS4. The G. hoi and G. claroideum isolates were \nobtained from spores in lyme grass dunes in \nIceland (Greipsson et al. 2002). The TerraVital-D \nproduct contained an optimized mixture (5% \nof weight) of slow-release fertilizers: natural \nhumates, seaweed extract and serpentinite. At \nboth sites the inoculum was tested at different \napplication levels (Table 1); at the coastal site \nthe levels were two, 12 and 24 g m-2 (the latter \nwas the dose of inoculum recommended by the \ninoculum producer) along with an un-inoculated \ncontrol. The same levels and an un-inoculated \ncontrol were also used at the inland site along \nwith the third inoculum dose of 36 g m-2. The \ninoculum was added once during the sowing of \nthe experiment (see Experimental design and \nestablishment procedure). Initial fertilization\nFor the initial fertilizer treatment during \nsowing a granulated NP fertilizer, Fjölmóði 2 \n(Áburðarverksmiðjan, Reykjavík, Iceland), was \napplied, which contained 23% N and 5.2% P. \nAt the coastal site two levels of this fertilizer \nwere tested, 10 and 20 g m-2, the latter being the \nnormal dose used for lyme grass sowings (Table \n1). The lower dose equaled 2.3 g N m-2 and 0.5 g \nP m-2 and the higher dose 4.6 g N m-2 and 1.0 g P \nm-2. At the inland site, the same fertilizer levels \nwere applied plus an unfertilized control (Table \n1). Experimental design and establishment \nprocedure\nA full factorial experiment was laid out at both \nsites. The size of treatment units (plots) was \naround 5 x 30 m or 150 m2. The minimum \ndistance between plots was 5 m. The 12 plots at \nboth sites were randomly distributed within each \nof five blocks. In total, 60 plots were seeded at \neach site. After dividing each plot in two in the \n2nd summer for re-fertilization purposes, the \ntotal number of subplots was 120 at each site. The experiment at the coastal site was seeded on \n16 May and at the inland site on 16 June 2003. For seeding the experiments, a tractor driven \ndrill-machine, modified for difficult terrain for \nlarge-scale revegetation purposes, was provided \nby the Soil Conservation Service, Iceland. The drill machine had two containers, one for \nthe lyme grass seeds and one for the fertilizer. Prior to sowing of each appropriate treatment, \nthe AMF inoculum dose was mixed with the \ngranulated fertilizer dose and the drill machine \nseed and inoculum-fertilizer outputs adjusted \nto scheduled rates. The lyme grass seeds were \ndrill-seeded to a depth of approximately 5 cm \nand the fertilizer or the inoculum-fertilizer \nmixture placed around 1-2 cm below the seed \nfurrow. Re-fertilization\nTo examine the effects of repeated fertilization, \nthe 150 m2 plots were split across in two \nsubplots equal in size and either one chosen \nTable 1.

The re-fertilization \nwas done in June in the 2nd and 3rd summers after \nsowing and the dose was 20 g m-2 y-1 (Table 1). In the 2nd summer the NP fertilizer Fjölmóði \n2 (23% N, 5.2% P) was applied, but in the 3rd \nyear a NPK fertilizer Fjölgræðir 7 was used \n(Áburðarverksmiðjan, \nReykjavík, \nIceland), \ncontaining 22% N, 6.1% P, 7.5% K, 1.6 % Ca \nand 2% S. In the 2nd summer this equaled 4.6 g \nN m-2 and 1.0 kg P m-2 and in the 3rd summer 4.4 \ng N m-2 and 1.2 g P m-2. Sites\nThe coastal study site was situated in the middle \nof the glacio-fluvial area Mýrdalssandur which \ncovers 700 km2 of the south coast of Iceland \n(Figure 1). It has been formed by reoccurring \nflood events in past centuries, the largest having \na peak flow rate of 300,000 m3 s-1 (Thordarson \n& Larsen 2007), during volcanic eruptions \nunder the Mýrdalsjökull glacier. In addition, \nglacial rivers and smaller floods continuously \ndeposit silt and sand in the area, which provides \na constant source of drifting sand. The inland study site lies in the eroded \nvolcanic area of Árskógar, covering around 100 \nkm2 near Mt Hekla volcano (Figure 1). The area \nwas previously covered with birch woodland \nand fertile Andosols, but following the loss of \nwoodland cover due to human activities in past \ncenturies, large scale erosion converted the area \nlargely into a desert. Exposed lava outcrops often \noverlain with fresh pumice and ash from resent \nvolcanic eruptions in Mt Hekla (Thordarson \n& Larsen 2007) cover the landscape and are a \nsource of drifting sand. The sites chosen for the experiments were \nflat unsheltered sand-terrain, fluvial in origin, \nwith less than 1% plant cover. In Iceland, sandy \nareas are generally glacio-fluvial and volcanic \nin origin and mostly consist of black basaltic \nvolcanic glass (Arnalds et al. 2001). Unvegetated \nsands contain very low amounts of N (<0.1 g kg-1)\ndue to lack of organic matter and are low in \navailable P, enhanced by high P-retention of soil \ncolloids (Arnalds & Kimble 2001). The coastal study area has a coastal climate \ntype Cfc (Peel et al. 2007), where the annual mean \ntemperature is around 5°C, and January and July \naround 1°C and 12°C, respectively (estimated \nfrom the nearest weather stations; Icelandic \nMeteorological Office 2015). Precipitation is \nevenly distributed throughout the year, around \n2000 mm y-1 (Icelandic Meteorological Office \n2015). In contrast, the inland study area falls in \nbetween two climate groups; a coastal climate \ntype Dfc and tundra climate ET (Peel et al. 2007), where the annual mean temperature \nis around 2°C, and January and July around \n-3°C \nand \n10°C, \nrespectively \n(estimated \nfrom the nearest weather stations; Icelandic \nMeteorological Office 2015). Precipitation is \nevenly distributed throughout the year, around \n1000 mm y-1 (Icelandic Meteorological Office \n2015). Some sections of both study areas have been \nsubject to intensive revegetation activities in \npast decades, including large scale areal and \nground sowing and fertilization (Aradottir 2007; \nGunnarsson & Indridadottir 2009). Harvest and evaluation\nLyme grass plant density (number of plants \nper area) and plant above-ground yield (dry \nweight per area) were evaluated in August-\nSeptember for the first three summers after \nsowing, in 2003-2005, at the coastal site, but \nfor the first two summers at the inland site. For this, three 0.25 m2 squares were selected \nrandomly within each 75 m2 subplot and all \nplants counted and harvested. Above-ground \nyield of associate vegetation within the squares \nwas also simultaneously harvested. New lyme \ngrass tillers were counted annually for the first \ntwo summers at both sites to evaluate the rate of \nvegetative regeneration, but otherwise included \nin the total number of plants. Average individual \nplant size was derived from plant density and \nabove-ground yield. Above-ground parts of \nlyme grass and associate vegetation were dried \nat 70°C to a constant weight and weighed to the \nnearest milligram. The occurrences and density \nof flower spikes were monitored throughout \nthe study period. In the 11th summer after \nestablishment (2013), lyme grass plant height \nAMF INOCULATION OF LYME GRASS SEEDLINGS\n64     ICELANDIC AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES\nand density, cover of lyme grass plants and \nassociate vegetation, and the height of sand \naccretion were measured. In the 2nd summer after sowing, root samples \nwere taken at random from three excavated \nseedlings in each subplot from around 20% of \nall subplots at the coastal site to estimate root \nfungal colonization. In the 3rd summer, root \nsamples were also collected from three randomly \nchosen plants at all subplots in two blocks at \nthe inland site and from all subplots in all five \nblocks at the coastal site. Root samples within \na subplot were combined to make one sample. Sampling was done in August-September. The \nroot samples were preserved in 70% ethanol. Before examination, the roots were carefully \nrinsed with tap water, and cleared in 10% KOH \nand then stained with 1% Parker Quink Ink \nin lactoglycerol (Vierheilig et al. 1998). Root \nsubsamples (total root length >25 cm) taken \nat random from the original samples, were \nmounted on glass slides and examined under a \ncompound microscope at x 200 magnification. Quantification of AMF colonization, AMF \narbuscules and vesicles was done on randomly \nselected slide positions according to McGonigle \n(1990) with a minimum of 100 root intersections. The AMF parameters are expressed per root \nlength. The occurrence of other fungi was also \nregistered in the same manner. Statistical analysis\nTo study effects of independent variables on \nresponse parameters for both experiments, a \nfactorial ANOVA was applied. Up to three-way \ninteractions were included in the model for plant \nand fungal parameters plus the main effects of \nblocks in the experiments. The following model \nwas used:\nYijklr = µ + ai + bj + ck + dl + er + (ab)ij + (ac)ik + \n(ad)il + (bc)jk + (bd)jl + (cd)kl + (abc)ijk + (abd)ijl + \n(acd)ikl +(bcd)jkl + εijklr, \nwhere:\nYijklr is response variable jiklr\nµ is variable mean\nai is fertilizer effect at i levels\nbj is AMF inoculum effect at i levels\nck is seed effect at i levels\ndl is re-fertilization effect at l levels\ner is block effect (random effect at five levels, r)\n(ab)ij + (ac)ik + (ad)il + (bc)jk + (bd)jl + (cd)kl are \nsecond order treatment interactions\n(abc)ijk + (abd)ijl + (acd)ikl +(bcd)jkl are third order \ntreatment interactions and\nεijklr error term of variable response. The model for the inland site did not contain \nthe effect c, as seed rates were fixed at this \nsite. Tukey’s HSD test and Least Squares \nMeans were used to find significant main and \ninteraction effects, respectively. Principal component analysis was used to \ncalculate eigenvalues of treatment effects and \nresponse variables. Also included for the inland \nsite in the 3rd summer was the AMF colonization."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-06-10T17:08:34.154994Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T19:15:15.024960Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":8,"annotations":[{"id":8,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":22,"end":40,"text":"response

Furthermore, the three-\nway interaction between fertilizer, inoculum and \nseed rate (Table 3) showed that the highest doses \nof all variables resulted in the highest yield, \n20.3 g m-2 (not shown). In the 2nd summer, the \ninteraction between fertilization and inoculation \n(Table 3) showed that the increase in yield due \nto a larger fertilizer dose was only realized with \nun-inoculated plants, where yield reached 48.5 \ng m-2 (Figure 5a). Doubling of fertilizer influenced plant \ndensity in the 2nd summer, increasing it by 19% \n(Figure 4d). Inoculation, however, affected \nplant density in the 1st summer, increasing \nplant density by around 50% regardless of \ninoculum dose (Figure 4e). Doubling the seed \nrate increased it by 36% and 26% in the 1st and \n2nd summers, respectively (Figure 4f). In the 1st \nsummer, variable interactions (Table 3) showed \nthat the positive response in plant density to \ninoculation was enhanced at the higher fertilizer \nand seed rate, reaching 59.9 and 67.5 plants m-2, \nrespectively (not shown). In the 1st summer, inoculation increased \nplant size by around 50%, regardless of \ninoculum dose, and doubling of fertilizer \nincreased plant size by 31% (not shown). At the \nsame time, average plant size was greatest 0.37 \ng in treatments receiving the larger fertilizer and \nlarger seed dose at the lower inoculum level, as \nindicated by the three-way interaction between \nthese variables (Table 3). In the 2nd summer, \nplants receiving the larger inoculum dose were \n24% smaller than un-inoculated plants, while \nplants receiving the larger initial fertilizer dose \nwere 19% larger (not shown). The increase in \nplant size due to the larger fertilizer dose was, \nhowever, only apparent in un-inoculated plants, \nas indicated by the interaction between fertilizer \nand inoculum in the 2nd and 3rd summers (not \nshown). In the 3rd summer, initial fertilization \nstill had a positive effect on plant size (not \nshown). At the same time, the three way \ninteraction between fertilizer, inoculum and \nseed rate (Table 3) revealed that the positive \neffect on plant size of a larger fertilizer dose was \nonly significant with un-inoculated plants and \nthe larger seed dose (not shown). Lyme grass vegetative regeneration was \nlow in the 1st summer, but was stimulated by \ninoculation and reduced by a higher seed rate \n(Figures 4g, h & i). The interaction between \ninoculum and seed rate in the 1st summer (Table \n3) produced the highest rate of 0.05 tillers per \nseedling with high inoculum and low seed dose \n(not shown). In the 2nd summer, inoculation \nand high seed rate generally reduced vegetative \nregeneration (Figures 4h & i). At the same \ntime, vegetative regeneration was significantly \nincreased by a larger fertilizer dose (Figure \n4g). The interaction between fertilization and \ninoculation (Table 3) revealed that this response \nwas only realized among un-inoculated plants, \nwhere the regeneration rose to 2.4 tillers per \nseedling with ample fertilizer (Figure 5b).

Other plant species found at \nthe site were: Carex maritima Gunn., Plantago \nmaritima L. and R. acetosa. In the 1st summer, \nthe associate vegetation was reduced by \nincreasing seed rate, from 2.0 to 0.01 g m-2 (not \nshown). Early effects of re-fertilization\nIn the 2nd summer, repeated fertilization became \nthe main factor controlling lyme grass parameters \nand the growth of associate vegetation (Table 2 \n& 3). The response was greater at the coastal \nsite than at the inland site (Table 2 & 3, Figures \n6a-f). At the inland site lyme grass yield, plant size \nand vegetative regeneration rose by 90%, 66% \nand 100%, respectively, due to re-fertilization \n(Figures 6a-c). The interaction between initial \nfertilization and re-fertilization (Table 2) was \nsynergistic as greater lyme grass yield was \nattained with a large initial fertilizer dose and \nre-fertilization, reaching 32.6 g m-2 in the 2nd \nsummer (not shown). At the coastal site in the 2nd summer, \nlyme grass yield rose by 164% due to re-\nfertilization (Figure 6d). At the same time, plant \ndensity (Figure 6e), plant size and vegetative \nregeneration rose by 16%, 128% and 50%, \nrespectively, and associate vegetation more \nthan doubled (Figure 6f). In the 3rd summer, \nyield (Figure 6d), plant density (Figure 6e) and \nplant size shrank from the previous summer in \nplots without re-fertilization. Therefore, in the \n3rd summer, the difference between plants with \nand without re-fertilization grew to 550%, 57% \nand 319% for yield (Figure 6d), plant density \n(Figure 6e) and plants size, respectively. In \nthe 3rd summer, the three-way interaction of \ninitial fertilizer, inoculum and re-fertilization \n(Table 3) showed that plant size in re-fertilized \nplots at the lower initial fertilizer level was \ngreater with 12 g m-2 inoculum dose than other \ninoculum treatments. However, the 12 g m-2 \ninoculum dose produced smaller plants than \nother inoculum treatments at the higher initial \nfertilizer level (not shown). Another three-way \ninteraction between inoculum, seed rate and re-\nfertilization (Table 3) revealed that the negative \neffect of higher seed rate on plant size was only \nevident in re-fertilized plots that received the \nhighest inoculum dose (not shown). Mycorrhizal colonization\nIn the 2nd summer at the inland site, AMF \ncolonization of lyme grass averaged 7.1% of \nroot length and was negatively affected by the \nhigh initial fertilizer level, which lowered the \ncolonization rate by more than a half compared \nto other treatments (Figure 7a).

A sporadic occurrence of arbuscules, 0% \n- 1.5% of root length, at the inland site was \nalso dependent on variable interactions (Table \n2). More arbuscules were found among un-\ninoculated plants than those receiving the lowest \ninoculum dose at the moderate initial fertilizer \ndose, and more arbuscules were found among \nre-fertilized plants than without re-fertilization. At the coastal site, the average AMF \ncolonization was around 17.8% in the 2nd \nsummer but decreased in the 3rd summer to \n4.8%. No variables significantly influenced \nAMF colonization, but arbuscule and vesicle \nnumbers were influenced by input variables \n(Table 3). Arbuscule numbers in the 2nd summer \nrose around elevenfold, to 5.7% of root length, \nat the lower inoculum level as compared to un-\ninoculated plants (Figure 7b) and rose sixfold \nby doubling of initial fertilizer. Re-fertilization, \nhowever, negatively interacted with initial \nfertilizer (Table 3) and the highest arbuscule \nnumbers, 7.4% of root length, were found in \nplants that were not re-fertilized and had received \nAMF INOCULATION OF LYME GRASS SEEDLINGS\nInoculum (g m-2)\n0\n12 24\nVesicles (%)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n100\nSeeds (g m-2)\n50 100\nVesicles (%)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n100\na\na\nb\nb\nc\nd\nFertilizer (g m-2)\n0\n10 20\nAMF colonization (%)\n0\n10\n20\n100\na\nb\na\na\na\nInoculum (g m-2)\n0\n12 24\nArbuscules (%)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n100\na\nab\nb\nb\nFigure 7.

Vesicle \nnumbers in the 3rd summer were influenced by \ninoculation and seed rates (Table 3). Inoculation \nincreased by twenty times the occurrence of AM \nvesicles, regardless of inoculum dose (Figure \n7c), while doubling of seed numbers tripled AM \nvesicle formation (Figure 7d). Dark septate endophytes were found in 1.8% \nand 3.3% of root length at the inland and coastal \nsites, respectively, and were not influenced by \ntreatment variables. Parameters of matured lyme grass\nIn the 11th summer, re-fertilization still had a \npredominant effect on lyme grass parameters, \nbut treatments at the time of sowing were much \nless influential (Table 2 & 3). At both the inland \nand coastal sites, re-fertilization influenced all \nparameters (Table 2 & 3); re-fertilized plants \nat both sites were around 30% higher than \nplants without re-fertilization (Figure 9a), the \ndensities of re-fertilized plants at the inland \nand coastal sites were around 2.7 and 4.0 times \nhigher, respectively (Figure 9b), and lyme grass \nplant cover at the inland and coastal sites was \naround 2.6 and 5.7 times higher, respectively \n(not shown). Furthermore, sand accretion in \nre-fertilized plots at the inland and coastal sites \nwas around 8.0 and 70.1 times higher than \nwithout re-fertilization, respectively (Figure \n9c). At the inland site, destruction of study plots, \nwhere all seedlings were lost during winter \nfloods, was also influenced by re-fertilization \n(Table 2); around 62% more plots endured with \nthan without re-fertilization (Figure 9d). Less \nassociate vegetation grew in re-fertilized plots; \nits cover was 86% and 44% less at the inland \nand coastal sites, respectively, than in plots \nwithout re-fertilization (Figure 9e). Flower \nspike formation in the 11th summer at the inland \nsite was 5.0 times higher with re-fertilization \n(Figure 9f). The first flower spikes were \ndetected in the 7th summer after sowing but the \nvariation in onset time of flowering could not be \nexplained by treatment variables. No flowering \nwas detected at the coastal site. At the inland site in the 11th summer, the \npositive effects of fertilization at the time of \nsowing were still evident on lyme grass plant \ndensity and sand accretion (Table 2). These \nparameters were around three and ten times \nhigher, respectively, at the highest fertilizer dose \nthan without initial fertilizer (Figures 10a & b). Initial fertilization was even more important \nthan re-fertilization, preventing the loss of plots \ncaused by poor seedling survival. Around three \ntimes more plots endured when fertilizer was \ninitially applied (Figure 10c). At the inland site, the interaction between \nre-fertilization and initial fertilization was also \nsynergistic for plant density and sand accretion \nPlant height (cm)\n0\n20\n40\n60\nDensity (plants m-2)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nSand accretion (cm)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nSites\nInland\nCoastal\nFlowering frequency\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nSites\nInland\nCoastal\nAssociate veg. cover (%)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n100\n0\n20 \na\nb\nc\nf\ne\na\nb\na\nb\na\na\nb\nb\na\na\nb\nb\na\nb\na\na\nb\nb\nRe-fertilization (g m-2 y-1)\nPlot endurance (%)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nb\na\nd\nFigure 9.

The \ncolumns represent treatment means and their SE. Dif­\nferent column letters show significant differences be­\ntween treatments (P<0.05). 73\n(Table 2). In plots without re-fertilization, sand \naccretion was only present in initially fertilized \nplots, regardless of amount, but in re-fertilized \nplots, initial fertilization dose had a greater \ninfluence on sand accretion, which reached 40 \ncm in plots receiving the greatest amount of total \nfertilizer (not shown). Plant density also showed \na very similar pattern; it was lowest (1.8 plants \nm2) among plants not receiving any fertilizer \nbut rose to 27.6 plants m-2 with the higher initial \nfertilizer dose combined with re-fertilization. Associate vegetation cover was influenced \nby the interaction between initial fertilization \nand inoculation at the inland site (Table 2), \nwhere the highest cover, 0.6%, was attained at \na high inoculum level without initially applied \nfertilizer (not shown). At the coastal site (Table 3), doubling of \nthe initial fertilizer dose raised sand accretion \nby 20% (not shown). Initial fertilizer and \nre-fertilization showed a weak synergistic \ninteraction for sand accretion, where most sand, \n19 cm thick, accumulated on plots receiving the \ngreatest amount of total fertilizer. Inoculation, \nhowever, reduced plant density by 10%, as \ncompared to un-inoculated plants, regardless of \ninoculum dose. Furthermore, doubling of seed \nrate increased plant density by 10%, but reduced \nassociate vegetation by 25%. While plant height at the coastal site (Table \n3) was unaffected by inoculation in plots without \nre-fertilization, the height of re-fertilized plants \nreceiving the moderate inoculum dose was 8% \nlower than un-inoculated plants (Figure 11). Associate vegetation grew best without re-\nfertilization in combination with a low seed rate \n(Table 3), but was reduced by a combination of \nre-fertilization and a high initial fertilizer dose. Comparison \nof \nprincipal \ncomponent \nevolution revealed strong temporal changes of \ntreatment effects and variable responses in the \nexperiment (Figure 12a & b). While all lyme \ngrass parameters showed a rather close affinity \nthroughout the study period, the proximity \nwas closest in the 11th summer (Figure 12a & \nAMF INOCULATION OF LYME GRASS SEEDLINGS\nDensity (plants m\n-2)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nSand accretion (cm)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nFertilizer (g m\n-2)\n0 10 20\nPlot endurance (%)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\na\nb\nc\nb\na\na\nb\na\na\nb\na\na\nFigure 10.

The encircled areas contain all response variables in the \n11th summer, except for associate vegetation. 75\nstarted off in close proximity to lyme grass \nyield, plant size and vegetative regeneration at \nthe coastal site but became distinct from lyme \ngrass parameters in the 2nd summer (Figure \n12b). In the 11th summer, the coordinates for re-\nfertilization were approximating those for lyme \ngrass parameters, particularly at the coastal \nsite, but other treatment variables remained \ndissimilar (Figure 12b). The coordinates for \nassociate vegetation were different from other \nvariables throughout the study time (Figure 12a \n& b). AMF colonization in the 3rd summer at the \ncoastal site was distinct from other lyme grass \nparameters, but simultaneously approximated \nthe inoculation variable and associate vegetation \ncoordinates (Figure 12b)."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-06-10T17:08:36.268931Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T20:01:12.480402Z","inner_id":8,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
